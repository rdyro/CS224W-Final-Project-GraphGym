# Managing Experiments with GraphGym

### Introduction

Welcome to the repository accompanying our [blog post](https://medium.com/) by
Ricky Grannis-Vu and Robert Dyro on how to get started with
[GraphGym](https://github.com/snap-stanford/GraphGym).

We encourage you to explore our notebooks!

- `experiment.ipynb` for the basics and advanced GraphGym usage
- `analysis.ipynb` for analyzing the results of our GraphGym exploration
- `ray_examply.ipynb` for integration of GraphGym with [Ray](https://www.ray.io/ray-core).

### Ray Integration

We provide integration of [GraphGym](https://github.com/snap-stanford/GraphGym) with [Ray](https://www.ray.io/ray-core).
